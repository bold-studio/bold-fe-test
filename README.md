# Universe_Hexagon

### Basic requirements for the test assignment:

 1) Time to complete the test assignment - 2 days (48 hours)
 2) Use only Vanilla JavaScript Framework. It'd be better to prevent usage of additional libraries and plugins, but it's not mandatory.
 3) A page you're about to create should look similar to the layout. It means that all the critical elements would be checked for similarity with the design.
 4) Feel free to use CSS preprocessors to make your developing process easier
 
### Technology Stack

* HTML or Preprocessors HTML
* Css/Scss/Sass
* Vanilla JavaScript Framework
* Gulp/Webpack


## Junior front-end - test task

Your task is to develop a hero page placed following [this](https://www.figma.com/file/b9FClreuQaoZFCdY2L4afE/Untitled?node-id=2%3A2) link.
This screen represents some sort of a slider with ability to see short info about apcomming events.

#### Technical requirements

* The hexagon on the page are elements of the events list.
* When scrolling down/up, hexagons should move. For example, if you scroll down one step, central biggest hexagon will move with animation to the bottom hexagon, and the top hexagon must move in place of the central one.
* Total amount of hexagons is 5. But in case if number will grow, your page should work in the same way.
* Move hexagon to the center by clicking on it. Rest of the hexagons should move according to their positions. It's mandatory to change content of side blocks placed on the top left and bottom right sides. 
* Side containers contains the info only about the event in active hexagon.
* Inactive hexagons shows less info than the active one. So when hexagon becomes inactive, unnecessary content should be hidden.
